2003-01-19  Ole Laursen  <olau@hardworking.dk>

	* configure.in: Added da to ALL_LINGUAS.

2003-01-18  Glynn Foster  <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	* Makefile.am, configure.in, omf.make, xmldocs.make: Enable
	help documentation in the build.

	* help/C/zenity-C.omf, help/C/zenity.xml: Fix up silly errors.

2003-01-18  Glynn Foster  <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	* help/C/zenity.xml: Add in references to the screenshots.

2003-01-18  Glynn Foster  <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	* help/C/figures/zenity-calendar-screenshot.png,
	help/C/figures/zenity-entry-screenshot.png,
	help/C/figures/zenity-error-screenshot.png,
	help/C/figures/zenity-fileselection-screenshot.png,
	help/C/figures/zenity-information-screenshot.png,
	help/C/figures/zenity-list-screenshot.png,
	help/C/figures/zenity-progress-screenshot.png,
	help/C/figures/zenity-question-screenshot.png,
	help/C/figures/zenity-text-screenshot.png,
	help/C/figures/zenity-warning-screenshot.png: Add some 
	screenshots for the help documentation.

	* src/entry.c, src/msg.c: Don't set the text if it's NULL.

2003-01-18  Glynn Foster  <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	* help/C/zenity.xml: Only some examples and some screenshots
	and we're mostly done for a first draft.

	* src/calendar.c: Don't set the text if it's NULL.

	* src/main.c: Swap the order of the commandline dialogs so
	that we're alphabetical.

	* src/zenity.glade: Add some default strings.

2003-01-18  Glynn Foster  <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	* data/Makefile.am, data/zenity.png, src/about.c: Hooray! 
	Zenity now has an about window icon. It's very zen too.

2003-01-18  Glynn Foster  <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	* help/C/zenity.xml: Update the docs a little. I have absolutely
	no clue how the doc people don't get tired of this.

2003-01-18  Glynn Foster  <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	* data/Makefile.am, data/zenity-calendar.png, 
	data/zenity-entry.png, data/zenity-progress.png, 
	data/zenity-text.png: Some new window icons.

	* src/text.c: Fix crash where the GladeXML ref was getting 
	unref'd before we wanted to use it.

	* src/main.c: Fix up commandline parsing a little, although we
	should really add the parsing options for gtk+.

	* src/zenity.glade: Give some saner defaults.

	* THANKS, src/about.c: Update for all the people I stole icons 
	and code from.

	* TODO: Update accordingly.

2003-01-16  Mike Newman  <mike@gtnorthern.demon.co.uk>

	* src/tree.c: fix a segfault if a --list is constructed and there
	is no data to put in it. Since a list with no contents to select
	seemed pointless, return without showing dialog.

2003-01-15  Glynn Foster  <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	* help/C/Makefile.am, help/C/legal.xml, help/C/zenity-C.omf, 
	help/C/zenity.xml, help/Makefile.am: First initial template
	of the help documents. Still have to write the main bulk of
	it.

2003-01-14  Glynn Foster  <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	* Makefile.am, src/Makefile.am: Updates to make 
	distcheck. Wow, this is scarey, a 1.0 release is on the
	horizon. Applications like this shouldn't reach 1.0.

2003-01-14  Glynn Foster  <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	* configure.in: Update to add new gconf requirement.

	* src/zenity.h, src/about.c: Hurray for a new about box, 
	although it lacks an icon. I wonder if people would actually 
	like to see this as part of the dialog options. Can't think 
	of any reason to do so at the moment though. Large chunks
	copied from libgnomeui/gnome-about.[ch]

	* src/util.h, src/util.c: Add new helper functions because I 
	don't want to touch gnome_program with a bargepole. Copied from
	libgnome/gnome-url.[ch]

	* po/POTFILES.in: Add missing files. I think we have 
	everything now.

	* TODO: Update accordingly.

2003-01-14  Glynn Foster  <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	* src/Makefile.am, src/about.c, src/main.c, 
	src/zenity.glade: Add an about box. Still need to add 
	an icon, and implement the callbacks for Help and Credits. Extra
	hassle for not linking against libgnomeui. Sigh.

2003-01-14  Glynn Foster  <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	* src/tree.c, src/zenity.h, src/main.c: Add support to 
	separate the selected rows output with a character 
	with '/' used by default.

2003-01-13  Glynn Foster  <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	* src/calendar.c: Re-structure the code to pass in the
	ZenityData structure into the response_callback instead.

	* src/main.c: Fix the screwups in the commandline parser
	due to popt being teh suck.

	* src/msg.c: Don't unref the GladeXML before you use it.

	* THANKS: New file.

2003-01-13  Mike Newman  <mike@gtnorthern.demon.co.uk>

	* src/calendar.c, src/main.c, src/zenity.h: Make the calendar
	return a localised date, and provide a means to override this with
	a --date-format option which takes a strftime style string - 
	"%A %d/%m/%Y" for example.

2003-01-13  Glynn Foster  <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	* src/main.c: Improve error handling.
	* src/tree.c: Make --list actually return something 
	useful, although I still need to actually seperate
	things out so it's actually decipherable.

	* TODO: Update accordingly.

2003-01-09  Glynn Foster  <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	* src/calendar.c: Fix up the date string, although I guess
	this should be localized.

	* src/main.c: Add a new --pulsate option, which reads from
	stdin and pulsates the progress bar until we reach EOF.
	* src/progress.c: Rewrite to actually work. Don't really need
	GIOChannels here.
	
	* TODO: Updated accordingly.

2003-01-07  Glynn Foster  <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	* src/calendar.c, src/entry.c, src/fileselection.c,
	src/main.c, src/msg.c, src/progress.c, src/text.c,
	src/tree.c, src/zenity.glade, src/zenity.h: Fix up
	the response signal handlers. Use returns of 0 for
	'Ok' and 'Close', 1 for 'Cancel' and 'Escape' and 
	-1 for 'Uh Oh'. Get stuff printing to stderr. Fix up
	the error handling that I thought was improved,
	although still have issues with popt callback getting
	called numerous times because of more than one instance
	of the same kind is being used in poptOption.
	
	* TODO: Update accordingly.

2003-01-07  Glynn Foster  <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	* src/main.c: Fix up the error returns.

	* TODO: Update accordingly.

2003-01-06  Glynn Foster  <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	* src/calendar.c, src/main.c, src/progress.c,
	src/tree.c, src/zenity.h: Improve error handling...
	a lot.

2003-01-06  Glynn Foster  <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	* src/main.c, src/tree.c, src/zenity.h: Finish off 
	commandline parsing for the list dialog. Wow, this 
	is almost approaching usable ;)

	* TODO: Update accordingly

2003-01-06  Glynn Foster  <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	* src/main.c, src/msg.c, src/zenity.glade, 
	src/zenity.h: I love featuritis. Instead of fixing 
	stuff so it actually works, I add more stuff. Add
	support for info dialog.

2003-01-06  Glynn Foster  <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	* src/zenity.glade: Feeling stupid because I can't use
	glade. Thanks to jrb and jamesh for showing me the light.
	Update default strings to sensible stuff.

2003-01-06  Glynn Foster  <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	* src/main.c: Add functions to init and free the 
	parsing options. Still not terribly pretty though.

	* src/tree.c, src/zenity.h: Handle --column 
	argument.
	
	* TODO: Update accordingly.

2002-12-15  Glynn Foster  <glynn.foster@sun.com>

        * zenity/*: Initial import into cvs.gnome.org. Don't 
	expect things to work very well.
