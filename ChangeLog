	* src/main.c, src/tree.c, src/zenity.h: Finish off 
	commandline parsing for the list dialog. Wow, this 
	is almost approaching usable ;)

	* TODO: Update accordingly

	* src/main.c, src/msg.c, src/zenity.glade, 
	src/zenity.h: I love featuritis. Instead of fixing 
	stuff so it actually works, I add more stuff. Add
	support for info dialog.

	* src/zenity.glade: Feeling stupid because I can't use
	glade. Thanks to jrb and jamesh for showing me the light.
	Update default strings to sensible stuff.

	* src/main.c: Add functions to init and free the 
	parsing options. Still not terribly pretty though.

	* src/tree.c, src/zenity.h: Handle --column 
	argument.
	
	* TODO: Update accordingly.

        * zenity/*: Initial import into cvs.gnome.org. Don't 
	expect things to work very well.
