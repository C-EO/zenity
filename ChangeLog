	* src/zenity.glade: Feeling stupid because I can't use
	glade. Thanks to jrb and jamesh for showing me the light.
	Update default strings to sensible stuff.

	* src/main.c: Add functions to init and free the 
	parsing options. Still not terribly pretty though.

	* src/tree.c, src/zenity.h: Handle --column 
	argument.
	
	* TODO: Update accordingly.

        * zenity/*: Initial import into cvs.gnome.org. Don't 
	expect things to work very well.
